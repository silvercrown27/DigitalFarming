#	Plant Disease Recognition using AI
Plant Disease Recognition

This project aims to use artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze plant images and determine whether they are healthy or affected by diseases. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we can train a model to classify plant images accurately and provide insights to farmers for better decision-making regarding crop health.

Introduction
Plant diseases can have a significant impact on crop yields, leading to economic losses for farmers and food shortages. This project employs AI techniques to address this issue by automating the process of detecting and diagnosing plant diseases from images. The trained model can accurately classify images as either healthy or diseased, helping farmers take timely actions to prevent disease spread and improve crop yields.

Project Highlights
Utilizes deep learning techniques to classify plant images as healthy or diseased.
Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and receiving disease predictions.
Offers potential for real-time disease monitoring and decision-making in agriculture.
Empowers farmers with actionable insights to protect and enhance crop productivity.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/silvercrown27/DigitalFarming.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd DigitalFarming
Install the required Python packages using:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare a directory with plant images you want to analyze.
Modify the main.py script to point to your image directory.
Run the script:
css
Copy code
python main.py
The script will process each image, make predictions, and display the results.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model contains images of plants categorized into healthy and diseased classes. It's essential to have a diverse and representative dataset for accurate model predictions.

Model
The model architecture used in this project involves a pre-trained base (e.g., VGG16) followed by additional layers for classification. The pre-trained base extracts features from images, which are then passed through fully connected layers for classification.
